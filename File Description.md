# Steps to Run the Code

To run the code locally, simply run the main.py file. Please note that the buttons on the page will not work as they require a URL to point towards. Currently, they are pointing towards the hosted project pages (Visualize and Predict). However, you can individually run the Main.py, Visualize.py, and Predict.py.

# Things to Note

* The hosted project may run relatively slow due to resource constraints, so please be patient. This is because of the quota set by GCP on free resource
* Please read the final report in the Report directory to learn about this project in detail.
