<p style="font-size: 17px"> Are you tired of waiting for your food delivery to arrive while your stomach growls in protest? Well, what if I told you that there's a dataset out there that could help predict delivery times for all your favorite food delivery services? Enter the "Delivery Duration Prediction" dataset.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px"> This dataset contains information about over 2 Million food deliveries, including the time of day, the distance between the restaurant and customer, the food preparation time, and the actual delivery time. With all this data, it's possible to build a predictive model that could help estimate how long it will take for your next meal to arrive at your doorstep.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px"> Whether you're a foodie, a data scientist, or just someone who hates waiting for food, this dataset is sure to pique your interest. So why not take a closer look and see what insights we can uncover?</p>

*Tools and Models - Jupyter Notebook, Dash, XGBoost Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron Regressor, Decision Tree Regression, Support Vector Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors Regression, Linear Regression, PCA, Random Forest with Gini Importance, and Multi-Colinearity Detection.*

<h3> How to Run the Project </h3>

There are two ways to run the project:

<strong>Option 1: Running Locally</strong>

If you prefer to run the project locally, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository
2. Download the necessary data files and place them in the 'Data' directory
3. Run the 'Master.ipynb' notebook for an in-depth walkthrough of the project, including data preprocessing and modeling
4. Run 'Main.py', 'Visualize.py', and 'Predict.py' to view the dashboard one page at a time

<strong>Option 2: Viewing Hosted Project</strong>

Alternatively, you can view the final project without downloading anything by visiting the following links:

1. 'Master.ipynb' on GitHub (note that interactive plots may not be displayed)
2. The dashboard: https://dashapp-3h7gsvk4ca-nn.a.run.app/

<p style= 'color:#ff6666'> Please note that the dashboard may take a bit longer to render and display due to hardware limitations.</p>

Thank you for your interest in our project. We hope you find it informative and enjoyable to explore!
